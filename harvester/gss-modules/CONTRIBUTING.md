## Pull Request Process

1. For every new feature or fix developer should create a new pull request based on a specific git 
   feature branch. The author of the git feature branch should be easily identifiable by branch name.   
2. It's the developer responsibility to ensure her/his Pull Request is being reviewed. 
   If no reviews have been made, the developer must bring the issue in the morning scrum stand-up.  
3. It is required to include the JIRA Case number in the Pull Request title. 
   Developers are encouraged to provide additional description of changes being made.
   Developers are free to create few smaller, logically separated Pull Requests per one JIRA case.  
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer. 
   Use Squash strategy when merging the Pull Request. The final commit message must include
   the JIRA Case number and a short message describing what has been done.
5. It's the responsibility of the developer to remove the feature branch and perform any required
   clean up after the Pull Request merge.
